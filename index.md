## Hi! I'm Chris.

I used to be a computational Geochemist, you can see some work I did as an undergraduate [here](http://ammin.geoscienceworld.org/content/102/4/804). Moving on from my degree in Geology, I wanted broader application for techniques I used, so I came to the University of Tennessee as part of their Masters of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program. While at Tennessee, I've worked on projects in both R and Python, and taken coursework in Data Mining, Text Mining, Machine Learning (supervised and unsupervised) and Statistics. My most recent work was with Boeing, as a Data Science Intern. In fact, you can view my whole resume [here](http://cshurt.github.io/Shurtleff Resume September 2017.pdf).
