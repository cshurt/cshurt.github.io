## Hi! I'm Chris.

<p>I work at Caterpillar. Sometimes I build predictive models. Occasionally I build ETL pipelines. Mostly I make beautiful dashboards. I have the privilege of taking dense datasets, gleaning useful information, then sharing that information in stunning visualizations. I mostly work in Tableau, Power BI, SQL and Python - but I'm no stranger to R, Rshiny, html and in the distant past I could probably build you something in C++.</p>
<p>I have a Master's degree from the University of Tennessee in Business Analytics (MSBA). While at Tennessee, I worked on projects in both R and Python, and took coursework in Data Mining, Text Mining, Machine Learning, and Statistics. In a different life, I used to be a computational Geochemist; you can see some work I did as an undergraduate

For the curious, you can view my whole resume [here](http://cshurt.github.io/Resume.pdf).
