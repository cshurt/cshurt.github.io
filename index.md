## Hi! I'm Chris.

I'm a data scientist. I used to be a computational Geochemist, you can see some work I did as an undergraduate [here](http://ammin.geoscienceworld.org/content/102/4/804). I wanted broader application for techniques I used as an undergrad, so I came to the University of Tennessee as part of their Masters of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program. While at Tennessee, I've learned R from statisticians, and Python from Computer Scientists-along with a lot of statistics and a substantial amount of data manipulation and visualization from both. My most recent work was with Boeing, as a Data Science Intern. In fact, you can view my whole resume [here].

### Projects

I have a few projects here on Github, and I hope to be starting a few more.
