## Hi! I'm Chris.

I work at Caterpillar. Sometimes I build predictive models. Occasionally I build ETL pipelines. Mostly I make beautiful dashboards. I have the privilege of taking dense datasets, gleaning useful information, then sharing that information in stunning visualizations. I mostly work in Python, Tableau, Power BI, and SQL - Containerized in Docker or AWS, preferably.


I have a Master's degree from the University of Tennessee in Business Analytics (MSBA). While at Tennessee, I worked on projects in both R and Python, and took coursework in Data Mining, Text Mining, Machine Learning, and Statistics. In a different life, I used to be a computational Geochemist; you can see some work I did as an undergraduate [here](https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2017-5938).

  
For the curious, you can view my whole resume [here](http://cshurt.github.io/Resume.pdf).
